# Intelligent Loan Approval System

## Project Overview
The Intelligent Loan Approval System is a machine learning-based application designed to predict whether a loan application should be approved or not based on customer details. This system helps banks and financial institutions automate decision-making, reduce risks, and improve efficiency. The Phase 1 implementation focuses on data collection, preprocessing, basic modeling, and a simple interface.

## Phase 1 Features Implemented
- Data collection and preprocessing of customer and loan application details  
- Feature selection and engineering for relevant attributes  
- Implementation of classification models for loan approval prediction  
- Basic command-line interface for user input and predictions  
- Evaluation metrics to measure model performance  

## Technology Stack
- Programming Language: Python  
- Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy  
- Data Handling: CSV/JSON for data storage  
- Version Control: Git  

## Installation Instructions
1. Ensure Python 3.8 or higher is installed on your system  
2. Clone the repository to your local machine  
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt  
4. Install required dependencies using:  ```bashpip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage Guide
1. Launch the application from the command line  
2. Follow the prompts to enter customer and loan details (e.g., income, credit history, loan amount)  
3. The system will display whether the loan is **Approved** or **Rejected** based on inputs  
4. Optional: Provide actual outcomes for model performance feedback  

## Dataset Information
The initial dataset includes key attributes such as:  
- Applicant income  
- Co-applicant income  
- Loan amount and loan term  
- Credit history  
- Employment details  
- Property area  
- Gender, marital status, dependents  

## Current Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression baseline model  
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Model performance comparison using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  

## Phase 1 Limitations
- Limited dataset size and features  
- Basic command-line interface only  
- Accuracy may vary for rare/edge cases  
- No persistent user account system yet  

## Future Enhancements
- Web-based graphical user interface  
- Expanded dataset with real-world entries  
- Additional ML models (e.g., Gradient Boosting, XGBoost)  
- Integration with databases for storing applications  
- User accounts for tracking loan status
